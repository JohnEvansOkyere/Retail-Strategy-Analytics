# Retail Strategy Analysis with Quantum Data Analytics
Welcome to the Retail Strategy Analysis repository! This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using Quantum Data Analytics to derive actionable insights and improve business strategies. Below is a summary of the analysis conclusions and recommendations:

## Conclusion
After thorough analysis, the following key findings have been uncovered:

Sales Drivers: Sales have primarily been driven by three customer segments: Budget - older families, Mainstream - young singles/couples, and Mainstream retirees shoppers.

High Spend Segments: Mainstream young singles/couples and retirees contribute significantly to chip sales due to their larger population size. Additionally, these segments tend to pay more per packet of chips, indicating impulse buying behavior.

Brand Preferences: Mainstream young singles/couples exhibit a 23% higher likelihood of purchasing Tyrrells chips compared to the rest of the population.

Based on these findings, the following recommendations are proposed:

Optimized Placement: The Category Manager should consider off-locating some Tyrrells chips and smaller packs in discretionary spaces near segments frequented by young singles/couples. This strategy aims to increase visibility and capitalize on impulse buying behavior.

Quantium's Assistance: Utilize Quantium's expertise to identify target segments and measure the impact of changed placements. Quantium can provide recommendations on optimal placement locations based on segment analysis.
